# Aura Radio
## Description
Aura Radio is a web application that uses a music based widget that allows you to create/generate a playlist to fit into mood categories that you select. You create an account and are displayed with cards labeled with moods, on selecting the card you are given the option to easily create multiple playlists that will be stored in that card.

## User Story
A haven for pure music enjoyment, free from the distractions of likes, shares, and social media noise. Born from the desire to reconnect with the true essence of music, AuraRadio focuses on the listenerâ€™s emotional state by matching their mood with selectively curated playlists. 

## Installation
Once this repo has been cloned to your local system and opened in VS Code, you will need to install all the required packages. In your terminal, run 'npm i' and it will install the necessary packages.
